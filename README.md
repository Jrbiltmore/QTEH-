# Quantum Transcription Error Handling Module

## Overview

The Quantum Transcription Error Handling module is a part of the **SAGE Gene Therapy Project**. This module leverages quantum computing principles to predict and correct transcription errors in gene sequences. It enhances the accuracy of gene therapy by mitigating errors that could affect the effectiveness of the therapy.

## Features

- Predict potential transcription errors in a given gene sequence.
- Generate a quantum circuit to correct transcription errors.
- Apply quantum error correction to the generated circuit.

## Usage

To use the Quantum Transcription Error Handling module, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install qiskit numpy
```

2. Import the necessary functions and classes:

```python
from quantum_transcription_error import QuantumErrorCorrection
```

3. Initialize the `QuantumErrorCorrection` class with a gene sequence:

```python
gene_sequence = "AGCTTAAGGCGT"
error_handler = QuantumErrorCorrection(gene_sequence)
```

4. Predict errors, generate a quantum circuit, and apply correction:

```python
predicted_errors = error_handler.predict_errors()
quantum_circuit = error_handler.generate_circuit()
corrected_circuit = error_handler.apply_correction()
```

5. The corrected circuit can be used further in your gene therapy project.
